Bear Reviews
=======

An app for Berkeley students to read and write reviews for EECS professors.


p.s. the repo submitted for app proposal is here https://github.com/AmadeusSkywalker/CustomApp. The progress can also be checked there. I moved everyhing to my repo because my partner dropped the course and I wanted to have full access to the repo I'm pushing to. The project was not named "Bear Reviews" but it takes too much to change a project name so I instead only modified product display name.
