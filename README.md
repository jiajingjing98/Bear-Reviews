Bear Reviews
=======

An app for Berkeley students to read and write reviews for EECS professors.

Do pod install in RottenProfessors/ folder and run the workspace.

Upon logging in, the user will see a list of EECS professors sorted by their first names. The user can also choose to search for a professor at the top. By tapping a specific professor, the user is directed to an overview page of the selected professor where his/her current ratings are displayed. At the bottom there are two buttons. The pencil button on the right is for the user to write a new review for the professor. There are four ratings to give and the user can choose to leave a short review. The book button on the left is for the user to see what other people say about the selected professor. Only optional short reviews are displayed here (i.e. nothing will be added to this page if the user only gives four ratings but does not leave a short review).
