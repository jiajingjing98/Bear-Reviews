Bear Reviews
=======

An app for Berkeley students to read and write reviews for EECS professors.


p.s. the repo submitted for app proposal is this https://github.com/AmadeusSkywalker/CustomApp. The progress can also be checked there. I moved everything to my repo because my partner dropped this course and I wanted to have full access to the repo I'm pushing to (i.e. renaming and stuff). The project was not named "Bear Reviews". I tried to change it to "Bear Reviews" but it takes too much to change a project name so I instead only modified product display name.
